### Take home coding test - Kindle backend

Thank you for chosing to interview with OtO! Below are the instructions for your take home coding test:

1. The details of your task are mentioned in the `TASK.md` file

2. Kindly fork the repository and work off of your fork

3. Create a branch off of `master` and work on that. We encourage you to commit and push your changes periodically so we can incrementally look at your changes and thought process. This, however is not a hard core requirement

4. Create a pull request targeting master in your fork once you're done with the complete test

Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions.

Good Luck! :)
